# Autonomy

Hey there! Welcome to **Autonomy**, a little project I've been working on. It's not your typical finance app; it's more of a personal endeavor born out of a desire to help my girlfriend manage her finances as a newly self-employed tattoo artist. We figured if it could help us, it might be useful to someone else out there in the freelancing world.

## Why Autonomy? üå±

**Autonomy** is all about simplicity and personal use. When my partner embarked on her journey as a self-employed artist, we quickly realized that keeping track of finances, taxes, and all that adult stuff could get overwhelming. That's why I decided to build **Autonomy** to help her üíú.

## Features ‚ú®

Even though this is a personal project, **Autonomy** has a few features that might be useful to you:

- **Net Income Calculator:** Just input how much you're charging for a service, and it'll tell you what you'll take home after taxes.
- **Quarterly Tattoo List:** A specific feature for tattoo artists to track their work over the quarter.
- **Income and Bookings Management:** Record earnings and manage bookings in a straightforward way.
- **Deductible Expenses Tracker:** Keep a log of your expenses to know what can be deducted during tax season.
- **Analytics:** Get an overview of how you're doing financially with our simple analytics.

## Built With üíª

This little project wouldn't have been possible without this awesome stack:

- **React** - For building the UI.
- **React Router** - For routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling.
- **Standard Eslint** - For those annoying linting errors.
- **TypeScript** - For that sweet, sweet type safety.
- **Vite** - A blazing fast build tool.

## How to Contribute ü§ù

This is a very personal project, but if you're interested in making **Autonomy** even better, I'm all ears! Feel free to fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Let's make managing finances a tad easier for everyone.
